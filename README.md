# DyNAMoE-sim

# Simulator for the DyNAMoE accelerator architecture

Based on the DyNAMoE architecture

DyNAMoE is a NoC-based dynamic architecture which can dynamically map and run MoE layers with much better efficiency and performance in comparison the state-of-the-art GPUs and accelerators.

**Still under construction!!**
